# Carson-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to begin creating a portfolio for myself so I can begin to look more professional to future employers. I wamted to create a basic template that I can continue to add to and recreate in order to make my portfolio more appealing. I learned a lot about about building a site for yourself from scratch. I learned trying to portray a good portfolio of yourself does not come easy. A very important aspect to using css is flexbox and that became the hardest part of this project for me. I hope to add and redesign this portfolio as I come to learn more.

## Usage

I found one aspect hard to understand is using links and anchors. and being able to link to a certain spot on your page.

Another aspect was Flexbox and trying to get the hang of putting multiple elements into a container and understanding their relationship to one another
