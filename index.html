            My full name is Carson John Wayne Colgate. I've been a bar manager and mixologist helping revamp restaurant's cocktail's and beverage programs.
            I've spent my time understanding peoples likes and dislikes and have decided upon a new career path of learning the likes and dislikes in 
            the world of web development. I have a small family consisting of my girlfriend and our princess Colorado Mountain dog named Elsa. We enjoy
            the outdoors skiing ⛷ , hiking 🥾 , and we love hot springs 🏊 .
